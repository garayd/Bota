This was a little dry on the palate first but filled out considerably in time, lovely, loaded with tapenade, leather, dry and powerful, very black olive, meaty. This improved considerably the longer it was open. A terrific bottle of 1981, 96+ and improving. This may well be my favorite vintage of Beau except for perhaps the 1990.\n",

However, as I kept revisiting this what struck me was a unique lush and creamy textural element, along with signature flavors of toasted brioche and toasted almond. This sipper really grows on you the more you taste it. For current drinking pleasure this blows the 1996 Dom away.\n",
