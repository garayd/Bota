This was a little dry on the palate first but filled out considerably in time, lovely, loaded with tapenade, leather, dry and powerful, very black olive, meaty. This improved considerably the longer it was open. A terrific bottle of 1981, 96+ and improving. This may well be my favorite vintage of Beau except for perhaps the 1990."
